Folder for functions that facilitate navigation around the mission area.

Note that navigation scripts shouldn't directly control the motors. The scripts should return some other form of data for the main script to access and process further.

EXAMPLE: script to process hydrophone input should return the location of the pinger rather than executing commands to move in the direction of the pinger.
